# Community Hub Backend

This repository contains the backend for the Community Hub application. It's a TypeScript Node.js/Express API that provides endpoints for managing community resources, users, and content.

## What this project is

- A REST API written in TypeScript using Express.
- Structure includes `controllers`, `routes`, `models`, `middleware`, and utility helpers.
- Intended to be run locally during development and deployed to a Node-compatible hosting environment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (or the version specified in the project). Use nvm to manage Node versions: `nvm install 18`.
- npm or yarn.

## Quick setup

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. Build / Start in development

   If the project uses `ts-node` or a dev script, run:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   To build and run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

3. Environment variables

   Create a `.env` file in the project root (if required) and set the following values as needed:

   - PORT - port the server will listen on (default: 3000)
   - DATABASE_URL - connection string for your database (if used)
   - JWT_SECRET - secret used to sign JWT tokens (if authentication is implemented)

   Example `.env`:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/community_hub
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
   ```

4. Project structure

```
index.ts                 # app entry
package.json
tsconfig.json
controllors/             # controllers for handling requests
middleware/              # express middleware
models/                  # data models / ORM definitions
routes/                  # express routes
utils/                   # helper utilities
```

Note: The folder `controllors` appears to be intentionally named that way in this repository. Adjust if needed.

## Running tests

If tests exist, run:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

## Linting & Formatting

If project contains ESLint/Prettier configs, run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

## Development tips

- Use `nodemon` or `ts-node-dev` for faster development iteration.
- Add a `.env.example` to document required environment variables.

## Next steps / TODOs

- Add `README` sections specific to authentication, database migrations, and API documentation once those parts are present.
- Add `Postman` or `OpenAPI` specs for the API.

If you'd like, I can update the README with exact scripts from `package.json`, or create a `.env.example` and basic API docs. Tell me how detailed you'd like it.
